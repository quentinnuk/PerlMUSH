*beginner
BEGINNER
Welcome to PurlMUSH. PurlMUSH is a new and innovative look at MU*ing, using 
the powerful language of Perl.

If you are new to MU*s, you will want to read the following topics first:

clothing
moving
talking
topics

Type "help clothing" to read that topic.

*clothing
CLOTHING
When your character is first created, it is not much to look at. Be sure to set 
your description with the @desc command.

@describe me = You see a tall newspaperman with a button nose.

Type "look me" to see yourself.

Next, if you wish, set your gender with the @sex command:

@sex me = male

You can abbreviate most commands.

Next, you will probably want to read the "help moving" topic.

*moving
MOVING
To move from room to room in PurlMUSH, just type the direction in which you want 
to move. Usually the possible directions are mentioned in the description of the 
room you are in. Typical exits include north, south, east, west, and one-letter 
abbreviations of the above. You may see the message "Huh?" if a particular
exit is not available from the current room.

Example:

You are in the dining room. There is a door to the north.
n
You are in the hallway.

Next, you will probably want to read the "help talking" topic.

*talking
TALKING
You will often encounter other players on the MUSH.  To converse with them, use 
the "say" command, which can be abbreviated to a single " (double quote) 
For example:

say hello
You say hello.
"hello
You say hello.

If you want to express action or emotion, use the emote command, which can be 
abbreviated to a single : character. For example:

emote cries.
Bob cries.
:cries.
Bob cries.

To learn about conversing on specific topics, move on to "help topics". 

*topics
TOPICS
Often people want to discuss a subject of limited interest without leaving a 
public area. To make this less annoying for everyone, "topics" are provided.
By default, everyone hears what is said on a topic, but users can elect to 
"@leave" topics. 

Users speak on a topic by prefacing the topic name with a comma:

,geek I love the gd graphics library.
You say, "I love the gd graphics library." <geek>
You can also emote on a topic using the ; character.

;geek blushes hotly.
Tom blushes hotly. <geek>

For more information, and examples, see "help @topic", "help @join" and "help 
@leave".

To learn about creating objects, move on to the "help building" topic.

*building
BUILDING
To create an object, use the @create command:

@create Can of Cheese-B-Gone
Can of Cheese-B-Gone has been created as #188.

Then describe the object. Try the following commands. Note that abbreviations 
can be used:

@desc can = The can is of the usual ozone-destroying aerosol type.
look can
inventory
drop can
get can
@recycle can
To learn more, see the "help locking" topic, or move on to "help rooms".

*locking
LOCKING
You may wish to lock an object so that only certain people can pick it up, or 
lock an exit so that only certain people can move through it. Locks can refer 
to both people and objects. If you lock an object to a person, only that person 
can pick it up. Place an * in front of the person's name when locking the 
object. If you lock an object to another object, the second object must be in 
the possession of a person attempting to use it. You can also build complicated 
locks using & (AND), | (OR), ! (NOT), and ( and ) to group expressions.

Got all that? Here are some examples:

@lock can = me
@lock can = !*Bob
@lock north = key
@lock south = !(bluekey | greenkey | redkey | prize)

To find out how to control what people see when a lock succeeds or fails, see 
the "help messages" topic. To move on, see the "help rooms" topic.

*messages
MESSAGES
To control what a user sees when she fails to pass a lock, use @fail:

@fail north = You can't unlock the door. Guess you need a key.

To control what the audience sees, use @ofail. Note that the player's name 
always appears first:

@ofail north = tries to open the door, but $s doesn't have a key.

$s is a substitution which inserts the correct pronoun. There are several 
others; see the "help substitutions" topic for more information.

To control what a user sees when she successfully passes a lock, use @success. 
To control what the audience sees, use @osuccess.

To move on, see the "help rooms" topic.

*rooms
ROOMS
Eventually, you will want to create a home of your own for your character. Try 
your own variation on the following commands. 

@dig Palace of Wonderful Things
@link me = #XXX               (Type the number @dig reports to you, not XXX)
home
@desc here = Welcome to the Palace. Try the trapdoor down or press the button.
@open down;d = #0             (Or the number of a room set linkok on this MUSH)
@desc down = A trapdoor in the floor beckons you downwards.
@open press button;button = home

Exits can have many alternate names, separated by semicolons. "home" is a 
special destination which takes the player to the home he or she is attached to 
by the @link command. "nowhere" is another special destination which goes 
nowhere!

Note that you can use the @link command to change the destination of the down 
exit, or any exit, at a later time. @link is also useful to set the home of 
your objects. 

*@sex
@SEX
PurlMUSH objects can have a gender, to be used with the substitutions that 
generate gender-specific pronouns (See: help substitutions). 

Use the @sex command to set the gender of an object.

Usage:

@sex me=Male
@sex Joanna=Female

*flags
FLAGS
Every PurlMUSH object can have one or more flags set. You can use the @set 
command to set or clear a flag:

@set me = !dark

dark                   Contents of room not visible (except to "examine")
linkok                 OK for anyone to link exits TO this room
jumpok                 OK for anyone to teleport to this room
buildok                OK for anyone to link exits FROM this room
sticky                 This object goes home immediately when dropped
puzzle                 If set for room, force drop all on "home" or "@tele"
abode                  OK for anyone to set their home to this room
grand                  This room is huge; entrances, exits are silent
book                   Anyone can "sign" this object, adding text
once                   Used with book: a second signature replaces the first

expert                 If set, you must type a " before things you say
nospoo                 Tells you who really said something 
builder                The player is permitted to build things and rooms
creature               This player is actually a creature written in Perl
nocreatures            This room does not admit creatures

*substitutions
SUBSTITUTIONS
Commands like @fail, @ofail, @success, and @osuccess set messages to be 
displayed when a player fails or succeeds in manipulating an object or exit. To 
make sense, these messages must contain the correct pronouns. The following 
substitutions are available, and output the correct pronoun or name depending on 
the player's flag settings and name:

Substitution    Name                  Outputs
%s              subjective            he, she, it, or name
%n              name                  name
%p              possessive            his, her, its, or name's
%a              absolute possessive   his, hers, its, or name's
%o              objective             him, her, it, or name name
%r              reflexive             himself, herself, itself, or name
%%              Percent sign          %

If the above substitutions are capitalized, the output will also be capitalized.

wizards. Also note that many ordinary commands have far fewer restrictions when 
used by wizards.

@link dog = here
@link dog = #27

*@open
@OPEN
The @open command is used to open a new exit from this room to a different room 
ID. The destination must be a room. Every exit must have a destination, 
although it is possible to @lock an exit so that it never succeeds. Many 
synonyms for the exit's name can be provided to accommodate reasonable guesses 
on the player's part. The destination can be changed later using the @link 
command.

Usage:

@open n;north;out = #322

*@fail

and @odrop.

Usage:

@ofail north = pounds senselessly on the door.

*@success
@SUCCESS
The @success command is used to establish a success message which the player 
will see when successfully attempting to get an object or use an exit. See

traveled into. See also locking, substitutions, @lock, @success, @osuccess, 
@fail, and @ofail.

*@lock
@LOCK
The @lock command is used to control which players can get a particular object 
or pass through a particular exit. Locks can refer to both players and objects. 
If a lock refers to a player, then that player can use the object. If a lock 
refers to an object, then the player can use it if the player is carrying the 
specified key. Objects and players can be combined using & (AND), | (OR), 
! (NOT), and ( and ) (parentheses to group expressions).

If players are mentioned in the lock, it is crucial that an * appear before the 
name of each player.

To clear a lock, place nothing on the right-hand side of the = sign.

Usage:

@lock north = *jessica
@lock south = (!*roger) & blue key

*@boot
@BOOT
The @boot command is used to immediately disconnect a particular player (for 
now). No permanent damage is done to the user's character. Only wizards can use 
this command.

Usage:

@boot player

*@clean
@CLEAN
The @clean command is used to "clean up" the current room. Every object that

for currently connected players. Only the owner of the room or a wizard can use 
this command.

Usage:

@clean

*@find
@FIND
The @find command is used to locate missing objects by name. This is useful if 
you have forgotten the id number of a newly created room.

Usage:

@find name

*@recycle
@RECYCLE
The @recycle command is used to recycle (destroy) an object, reclaiming the 
space to be reused by a new object. If the object contains other objects, they 
are immediately dropped. If the object is a room, room #0 is set as the new home 
of objects residing in the recycled room. If there are exits which lead to a 
recycled room, those exits are directed to room #0. @recycle cannot be used 
directly on players, but wizards can use @toad first to turn players into 
inanimate objects. 

@recycle cannot be undone. Be sure you want to recycle the object. This command 
cannot be abbreviated.

Usage:

@recycle object

*@toad
@TOAD
The @toad command is used to turn a character into a slimy toad (an inanimate 
object). The character's possessions are recycled if no recipient is specified 
to accept them. Only wizards can use this command. This command cannot be 
abbreviated.

Usage:

@toad player
@toad player = recipient

*@shutdown
@SHUTDOWN
The @shutdown command is used to shut down the MUSH, disconnecting all current 
users and writing the database to disk. This command cannot be abbreviated.

*@reload
@RELOAD
The @reload command is used to reload the mud source code from mudlib.pl, after 
first writing the database to disk. This often allows the installation of new 
features without a shutdown, although of course bugs in the changes you have 
made could crash the mud.  This command cannot be abbreviated.

*@dump
@DUMP
The @dump command is used to write the database to disk immedately. Note that 
the server automatically writes the database to disk at regular intervals. This 
command is nonetheless useful when a particularly important action has just been 
performed. Only wizards can use this command. This command cannot be 
abbreviated.

*@gag
@GAG
The @gag command allows you to completely ignore another player. Use this 
command if you find you simply can't stand them, no matter what. Use examine me 
(not look me) to see who is on your gag list.
